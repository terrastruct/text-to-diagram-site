Show the flow of data, concretely, with a diagram of SQL tables pointing to
each other, otherwise known as an ERD (Entity Relation Diagram).

There's a lot of variation in how the different langauges implement this.
PlantUML and Mermaid have mature support for different types of endpoints,
which is showcased here. GraphViz does not support table shapes natively, but a
replica built with HTML is used instead to get a comparable render. Notice that
Mermaid declares a new graph type, whereas D2 and PlantUML change the shape.
